# CampusPay: Decentralized Student Finance on Algorand 🎓💎

CampusPay is a premium Web3 financial ecosystem designed for the modern campus. It leverages Algorand's low latency and microscopic transaction fees to solve real-world student challenges: from splitting coffee bills to funding research projects and managing campus event tickets.

## 🚀 Core Features

### 1. Send & Receive CAMPUS Payments
- **Instant P2P Transfers**: Use Algorand ASAs (CAMPUS) for nearly instant settlement.
- **Micro-fees**: Every transaction costs only 0.001 ALGO, making it viable for small student purchases.

### 2. Smart Expense Splitting
- **Group Shared Costs**: Split rent, meals, or club expenses with peers.
- **On-Chain Settlement**: Mark participants as paid only when the transaction is confirmed on the ledger.

### 3. Decentralized Event Ticketing (NFT-style)
- **Mint as You Buy**: Tickets are recorded as on-chain ownership, preventing fraud.
- **QR Check-In**: Instant verification via wallet address scanning on the profile page.

### 4. Campus Fundraiser (Crowdfunding)
- **Launch Campaigns**: Raise CAMPUS tokens for clubs, charities, or personal causes.
- **Full Transparency**: See exactly who contributed and watch the progress bar update in real-time on-chain.

### 5. Campus Vault (Savings & Goals)
- **Goal-Based Saving**: Set financial targets (e.g., "Graduation Trip") or "Tuition Fees".
- **Internal Vaulting**: Move tokens into a secure vault to keep them separate from your daily spending.
